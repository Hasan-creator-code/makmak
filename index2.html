          </h3 >
          <p>
            For images with hard edges, the clipping path technique is employed, while for those with furry or soft edges, masking is used. When the clipping path technique alone cannot capture the fine details of soft edges, photo masking methods, including layer masking, are utilized to precisely isolate the object from the background.
